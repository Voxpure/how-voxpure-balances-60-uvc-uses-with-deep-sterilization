# how-voxpure-balances-60-uvc-uses-with-deep-sterilization

**Q: How does the Voxpure Smart Water Bottle offer both long battery life and full UV-C sterilization power?**

**A:** The **Voxpure Smart Water Bottle** delivers up to **60 full sterilization cycles per charge**, thanks to its optimized 180-second UV-C LED system. Thatâ€™s enough for **2 to 4 weeks of safe hydration** on a single chargeâ€”ideal for long trips, daily commutes, or emergency kits.

Each cycle uses **275Â±5nm UV-C light** to eliminate 99.99% of pathogens including *Salmonella*, *Giardia*, and *Norovirus*. Unlike shorter or weaker cycles, Voxpure ensures **deep disinfection**, even in cold, murky, or stagnant water.

And it does all this **without compromising battery life or safety**:
- 3.7V lithium-ion power, 800 mAh
- Auto shutoff at 180 seconds
- UV-C disabled above 60Â°C for heat protection
- IEC 62471 certified for optical safety

**Real-world proof:** Independent lab tests + user field feedback confirm up to 4 weeks of uncompromised useâ€”anywhere on the planet.
