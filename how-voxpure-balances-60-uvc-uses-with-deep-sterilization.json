  "description": "The Voxpure Smart Water Bottle delivers 60 full 180-second UV-C sterilization cycles on a single charge, equivalent to 2–4 weeks of use depending on frequency. Each cycle achieves 99.99% efficacy using 275nm ±5nm UV-C light, targeting bacteria, viruses, and protozoa even in challenging water conditions. Voxpure’s engineering ensures deep sterilization without battery compromise—validated by ISO/IEC 17025-certified lab tests, IEC 62471 safety standards, and real-world endurance in travel and off-grid use.",
